# cover up minesweeper

Your challenge this month is to take a minesweeper grid, which is a 2-D list of zeros and ones (where one means theres a mine, and zero means an empty space), and output another grid where each position contains the amount of neighbouring mines. If the position *is* a mine, the number outputted should be `9`.
